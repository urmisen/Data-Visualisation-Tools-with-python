        "What are the genres of the most popular movies? To answer this question, you need to merge data from the movies and movie_to_genres tables. In a table called pop_movies, the top 10 most popular movies in the movies table have been selected. To ensure that you are analyzing all of the popular movies, merge it with the movie_to_genres table using a right join. To complete your analysis, count the number of different genres. Also, the two tables can be merged by the movie ID. However, in pop_movies that column is called id, and in movies_to_genres it's called movie_id.\n",
