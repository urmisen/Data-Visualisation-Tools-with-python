        "Most of the recent big-budget science fiction movies can also be classified as action movies. You are given a table of science fiction movies called scifi_movies and another table of action movies called action_movies. Your goal is to find which movies are considered only science fiction movies. Once you have this table, you can merge the movies table in to see the movie names. Since this exercise is related to science fiction movies, use a right join as your superhero power to solve this problem.\n",
