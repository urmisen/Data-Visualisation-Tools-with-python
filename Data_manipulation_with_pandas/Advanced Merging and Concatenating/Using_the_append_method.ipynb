        "The .concat() method is excellent when you need a lot of control over how concatenation is performed. However, if you do not need as much control, then the .append() method is another option. You'll try this method out by appending the track lists together from different Metallica albums. From there, you will merge it with the invoice_items table to determine which track sold the most.\n",
