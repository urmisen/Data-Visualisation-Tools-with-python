        "The leadership of the music streaming company has come to you and asked you for assistance in analyzing sales for a recent business quarter. They would like to know which month in the quarter saw the highest average invoice total. You have been given three tables with invoice data named inv_jul, inv_aug, and inv_sep. Concatenate these tables into one to create a graph of the average monthly invoice total.\n",

        "1. Concatenate the three tables together vertically in order with the oldest month first, adding '7Jul', '8Aug', and '9Sep' as keys for their respective months, and save to variable avg_inv_by_month.\n",
        "2. Use the .agg() method to find the average of the total column from the grouped invoices.\n",
