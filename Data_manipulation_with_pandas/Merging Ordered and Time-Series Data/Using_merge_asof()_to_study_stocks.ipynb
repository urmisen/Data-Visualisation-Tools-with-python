        "You have a feed of stock market prices that you record. You attempt to track the price every five minutes. Still, due to some network latency, the prices you record are roughly every 5 minutes. You pull your price logs for three banks, JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank Of America (BAC). You want to know how the price change of the two other banks compare to JP Morgan. Therefore, you will need to merge these three logs into one table. Afterward, you will use the pandas .diff() method to compute the price change over time. Finally, plot the price changes so you can review your analysis.\n",
