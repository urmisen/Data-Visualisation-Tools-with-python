        "There is an economic theory developed by A. W. Phillips which states that inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. The theory claims that with economic growth comes inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment.\n",

        "You will take two tables of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, containing unemployment and inflation data over different periods, and create a Phillips curve. The tables have different frequencies. One table has a data entry every six months, while the other has a data entry every month. You will need to use the entries where you have data within both tables.\n",
