However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.\n",
