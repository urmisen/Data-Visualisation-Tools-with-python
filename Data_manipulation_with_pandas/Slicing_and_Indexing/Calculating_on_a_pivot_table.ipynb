        "Pivot tables are filled with summary statistics, but they are only a first step to finding something insightful. Often you'll need to perform further calculations on them. A common thing to do is to find the rows or columns where the highest or lowest value occurs.\n",

        "Recall from Chapter 1 that you can easily subset a Series or DataFrame to find rows of interest using a logical condition inside of square brackets. For example: series[series > value].\n",
