        "# **Slicing index values**\n",
        "Slicing lets you select consecutive elements of an object using first:last syntax. DataFrames can be sliced by index values or by row/column number; we'll start with the first case. This involves slicing inside the .loc[] method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to slicing lists, there are a few things to remember.\n",
        "\n",
        "* You can only slice an index if the index is sorted (using .sort_index()).\n",
        "* To slice at the outer level, first and last can be strings.\n",
        "* To slice at inner levels, first and last should be tuples.\n",
        "* If you pass a single slice to .loc[], it will slice the rows.\n",
        "pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has country and city in the index, and is available.\n",

        "# **Instructions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Sort the index of temperatures_ind.\n",
        "2. Use slicing with .loc[] to get these subsets:\n",
